The SPV pays corporation tax on any taxable profit it generates, with the current UK Corporation Tax rate set at 19%. If the property’s value appreciates, Corporation Tax will also apply to the gain upon disposal. This future Corporation Tax liability is accounted for as Deferred Tax in the SPV’s valuation, ensuring it is reflected in the estimated share value Tokunize publishes for the property. \n\nFor example, if the property value increases by £10,000 over five years, a £1,900 Deferred Tax liability (£10,000 x 19%) would be recognized. This approach ensures that the investors who benefit from property appreciation are also responsible for the associated Corporation Tax."

          "title": "Understanding Tokunize’s EMM and Liquidity Pools",
          "content": "The market maker and liquidity pools within Tokunize operate as separate entities, allowing users the flexibility to engage with either one independently. In traditional financial markets, a market maker is an entity that continuously buys and sells assets to create a spot market price—the live price you see when trading stocks. This entity profits from the difference between the buying and selling prices, known as the spread.\n\nDue to regulatory limitations, Tokunize cannot act as a market maker directly. To address this, we’ve implemented a decentralized finance (DeFi) solution that emulates traditional market-making but leverages an algorithm instead of a single company. Funding for this market-making process comes from individual investors who contribute to “liquidity pools,” rather than from a centralized source.\n\nWhen you stake assets like property tokens, USDC, or both into a liquidity pool, you’re essentially lending them to the algorithm. This algorithm uses the USDC to buy property tokens and sells property tokens in exchange for USDC, directly interacting with users who place “market orders” instead of “limit orders.” The algorithm charges a fee on top of the standard Tokunize secondary market fee, akin to how traditional market makers earn through spreads.\n\nThese fees generate revenue for the market-making activities and are passed on to users who have provided assets to the liquidity pools, allowing them to earn a yield—the basis for the displayed APR values. This model enables individuals to provide liquidity for trading real-world assets, moving beyond assets valued solely through digital means or speculation.\n\nYou have the option to interact exclusively with the EMM by buying and selling property tokens via “market orders” without staking any assets. Alternatively, you can focus solely on providing liquidity by staking your assets, never directly interacting with the EMM through “market orders.” This system is highly flexible and entirely opt-in. Traditional limit orders remain available and are not affected by the EMM by default. Future updates may allow the EMM to trade directly against open limit orders.\n\nAll EMM fees are transparently displayed on the order confirmation page, and lending yields are shown on their respective liquidity pool pages. If you attempt to unstake or withdraw liquidity when there’s an existing imbalance in the pool, you may incur a penalty—sometimes significant and calculated on a sliding scale. This penalty is redistributed as rewards to other liquidity providers, incentivizing them to maintain their stakes. The last participant in a pool receives substantial additional rewards and yields. This mechanism helps prevent sudden withdrawals that could lead to volatile asset prices, addressing a key risk in traditional Automated Market Maker (AMM) architectures.\n\nBy staking property tokens, you can continue to receive rental income while also earning yield from staking, potentially enhancing your overall returns. However, your property ownership may fluctuate as your assets in the pool are traded over time, affecting your rental income accordingly. In some scenarios, you might temporarily earn only staking yields without rental income, while in others, you could receive most of your rental income plus staking yields, achieving higher returns than traditional rental property investments. Deciding whether to accept increased risk for the potential of greater rewards is entirely up to you.\n\nOur smart contracts enforce a maximum staking limit of 20% of a property’s circulating token supply in the pool, making staking opportunities available on a first-come, first-served basis. If a pool is full, you can attempt to deposit when space becomes available. There is no cap on the amount of USDC that can be staked in a pool. When placing large “market” orders relative to the pool’s supply, users may experience slippage, meaning their order could influence the market price. It’s important to be aware that large orders may not receive the initially quoted price per token due to this potential slippage."

          "title": "What are Liquidity Pool Tokens (LP Tokens)?",
          "content": "When you lend assets to a liquidity pool, you receive Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens in return. These LP tokens act as a “receipt” for your deposit, similar to a bank receipt that shows your deposited amount. The pool uses LP tokens to track the amount it owes you upon withdrawal.\n\nEach liquidity pool generates its own unique LP tokens, corresponding to the specific assets within that pool:\n- For Property Token Y → LP tokens for Property Token Y\n- For the USDC-Property Token Y pool → LP tokens for USDC in the Property Token Y pool\n\nThis structure means that each liquidity pool has a unique set of tokens, with LP tokens specific to that pool. Tokens from one pool cannot be used to interact with other liquidity pools.\n\nIt’s essential to keep your LP tokens secure. If they are lost, you won’t be able to retrieve your staked assets, and unfortunately, Tokunize cannot recover lost LP tokens. Since your assets are stored in a smart contract—a digital vault on the blockchain—Tokunize has no access to reclaim them if lost.\n\nYour LP tokens will be stored in your Tokunize Wallet if using Tokunize’s platform wallet, or in your external wallet if connected. You can view your LP tokens within the “Wallets” dashboard on Tokunize."

These additional fees are distributed to users who have lent assets to the liquidity pool, providing the source of your lending yield.\n\nYour share of the earned fees is proportional to the amount of liquidity you’ve contributed relative to other lenders in the pool.\n\nTo view and claim your rewards, navigate to the “Account” page. Rewards must be claimed manually; otherwise, they remain secured in the smart contract. Once claimed, you’re free to decide how to use these funds.\n\nYou may choose to reinvest your rewards to increase your earnings over time, or you can use them to acquire more real estate.\n\nAutomatic compounding of returns is not currently supported, so the displayed APY values don’t account for compounding. If you wish to compound, you’ll need to claim your rewards regularly and reinvest them to boost your returns over time.\n\nThe APY shown on your dashboard is the combined APY earned from staking. If you’re lending both property tokens and USDC, you’ll see the aggregated APY across both assets.\n\nRewards are issued in USDC, as transaction fees in the liquidity pool are collected in USDC.\n\nNote that USDC and property tokens may have varying rates based on trading supply and demand, as well as the assets available on each side of the pool."
