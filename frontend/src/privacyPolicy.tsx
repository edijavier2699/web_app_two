              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
              ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
              online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
              recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
              DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
              tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
              you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
