            <strong>Capital at risk.</strong> The value of your investment can go
            down as well as up. The performance information (including any
            expression of opinion or forecast) reflects the most up-to-date data
            at the time of production; publication is made in good faith on the
            basis of publicly available information or sources believed to be
            reliable. Past performance and/or forecasts (if stated) are not a
            reliable indicator of future performance. Interest and capital
            returned may be lower than expected. Gross rent, dividends, and
            capital growth may be lower than estimated. Exiting your investments
            (on the Exchange, via the instant liquidity option or 5-year
            anniversary process or according to targeted strategies) is subject to
            price and demand.

            Tokunize Marketplace trades are completed using USD Coin (USDC
            cryptocurrency) and smart contracts on a blockchain. If you use a
            payment method other than USDC to submit a buy order for a traded
            property, then you agree to purchase an equivalent quantity of USDC at
            the then current exchange rate. That is, you agree that your currency
            will be converted to USDC, and your buy order will be executed using
            USDC. USDC is a 1:1 representation of the US dollar on the blockchain
            that may fluctuate in value. In the event that your order is cancelled
            or expires, any unspent USDC will be returned to your Tokunize Wallet.
            If you later submit a sell order for your property tokens, and your
            sell order is filled, you will receive payment in USDC which can be
            converted to USD via third party cryptocurrency exchanges.
